## Electric Vehicle Purchase Prediction

Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining traction due to their eco-friendly nature and cost-saving benefits. However, predicting whether a customer will purchase an EV involves various factors such as demographics, preferences, and financial considerations.

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict EV purchases based on relevant features. By analyzing historical data and employing advanced algorithms, we aim to uncover patterns influencing customer decisions.

### Objective

The primary goal is to build a robust prediction model to assist automotive companies, dealerships, and policymakers. This model can inform marketing strategies, inventory management, and incentive programs to promote EV adoption.

### Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on customer demographics, preferences, financial status, and past purchase behavior.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
   
3. **Feature Selection**: Identify significant features influencing EV purchase decisions.
   
4. **Model Building**: Employ machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods to train the prediction model.
   
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for prototyping and analysis


### Conclusion

By accurately predicting EV purchases, this project can provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry and policymakers. With the increasing importance of sustainable transportation, such predictive models can drive informed decision-making and facilitate the transition towards a greener future.
